from the matching OnePlus 15 stock OTA. Do not reuse them on another platform.

## Build

The GitHub Actions build defaults to Simplified Chinese, Beijing time (UTC+8
without daylight saving), and a 24-hour clock. It also normalizes saved
`TAIST-8` timezone settings that still have daylight saving enabled.

```sh
cd ~/Desktop/AERA_16.0
source build/envsetup.sh
lunch twrp_infiniti-bp2a-eng
mka adbd recoveryimage
```

The output is written to `out/target/product/infiniti/`.
